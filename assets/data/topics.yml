          LiveDNS is Gandi's new DNS platform which includes an REST API and
          makes its easy for developers to updates their zones in real time
          with a few HTTP calls. This talk will give an introduction to the
          service and also update the audience on recently delegated top level
          domain names.

          High Available Database Architecture is so important.  It is more than
          just the HA but also scalable design to the demand.   MySQL Group
          Replication is one of the key features in MySQL 5.7 (since the
          release of 5.7.17).   The session will share the setup of MySQL Group
          Replication together with the MySQL InnoDB Cluster, in which the MySQL
          Shell, MySQL Router + MySQL Group Replication architecture go together
          to form a scalable and reliable db infrastructure to your
          application(s).

                Reproducible builds: Fulfilling the original promise of free software

          Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for
          malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary
          (or "compiled") packages to end users.
        - >
          The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification
          that no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by
          promising identical binary packages are always generated from a
          given source.
        - >
          This prevents against the installation of backdoor-introducing malware
          on developers' machines - an attacker would need to simultaneously
          infect or blackmail all developers attempting to reproduce the build.
        - >
          This talk will focus heavily on how exactly software can fail to be
          reproducible, the tools, tests & specifications we have written to
          fix & diagnose issues, as well as the many amusing "fails" in
          upstream's code that have been unearthed by this process. In addition,
          you will learn what to avoid in your own software as well as the
          future efforts in the Reproducible Builds arena.

          contributing to the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), there are
          lots of jobs available for the people with FOSS background. As a paid,
          full-time FOSS contributor Vaishali Thakkar has built her career
          around by contributing in one of the biggest open source project
          Linux Kernel]. In this talk, she aims to talk about giving an
          overview of valuable ways to contribute and how they relate to
          building a career in FOSS. She will also focus on some of the
          benefits of working in open source communities which are beyond money,
          including [but not limited to] how it leads to opportunities to travel,
          collaborate with different people around the world and satisfaction of
          working on big and interesting FOSS projects.

          <h3>General Description</h3>
          <p>
          Rust is great for building mathematical models and AI which is the
          talk of the hour and a great emerging domain is based on mathematics
          which can crunch realtime data to provide human level insights which
          helps in making logical decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
          There are already many crates in rust which provide AI units which
          help in implementing deep learning and reinforcement learning systems
          and algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
          Proposals basically deep dives into such implementations in rust and
          covers the benchmarks of performance of the rust crates with the
          industrial grade libraries such as tensor flow and caffe. The Talk
          touches upon the major problems in the industrial grade libraries and
          how rust can help in avoiding them.
          </p>
          <p>
          Demos of few mathematical models to perform prediction tasks and how
          to start off development of models from scratch in rust will be
          demonstrated.

          Studying satisfaction with life can assist evaluation of the effect
          of interventions mediating mental disorders, yet frequent or regular
          monitoring of SWL in longitudinal studies is laborious and often
          results in high dropout rate. In this study, we applied machine
          learning to social network data to predict SWL. Based on a variety of
          feature selection methods and a three-step random forest model, our
          language-based model for SWL reached an accuracy of 0.58
          (SWL split into three classes). Machine-predicted SWL scores showed
          higher validity coefficients than self-reported SWL scores when
          predicting certain life outcomes. Using the same method, we built
          three more models predicting respectively depression, personality,
          and self-disclosure, the accuracies of which were all over 0.50.
          Comparison of these models suggest that content words such as negative
          emotion words are the major indicators of SWL and a multi-step random
          forest model can make valid predictions for many psychological traits.

          The Haxe programming language is well known for its wide range of
          compilation targets. It is possible to compile a single Haxe code
          base to JavaScript, Java, C#, Python, C++, PHP, Lua, and more.
        - >
          Let's have some hands-on experience with the Haxe by building a simple
          game that is totally cross-platform - runs on desktops, mobiles, and
          browsers. We will explore Haxe’s modern language design and study how
          it produce performance efficient outputs.

          Participants should have programming experience with at least one
          programming language. Proficiency with JavaScript, Java, or C# is
          ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python,
          or Ruby is also sufficient. Participants should have some familiarity
          using the command line.

          Participants should bring their own laptop computer, with either
          Windows, Mac, or Linux installed.

          We will introduce the current status of VR software and hardware, and
          what WebVR fits in. Using the Mozilla-developed A-Frame project, we

          browser, on mobile with Google Cardboard, or even on a high-end head
          mounted display.

          great, but not necessary.

          Some limited amount of Google Cardboard will be lended for testing.
          The VR application can be developed and used without Google Cardboard
          or any other VR hardware.

          We use ZMQ as RPC transport between golang coroutine and python
          thread in web server. The problem is handling one web request will
          trigger multiple RPC calls between golang and python. The original
          implementation of the RPC does not bidirectional and multiplexing
          transport. As result, the call between golang and python will easily
          consumed all python thread in thread pool very easily. We implement
          a bidirectional and multiplexing transport, so we can reduce overhead
          and reuse blocked workers.

          Excel formulas can be quite slow when you're processing data files
          with thousands of rows. It's also especially difficult to maintain
          the files when you have some messy mixture of VLOOKUPs, Pivot Tables,
          Macros and VBAs.
        - >
          In this interactive workshop targeted for non-coders, we will make
          use of SQLite, a very lightweight and portable open source database
          library, to perform some simple and repeatable data analysis on large
          datasets that are publicly available. We will also explore what you
          can further do with the data by using some powerful extensions of
          SQLite.
        - >
          While SQLite may not totally replace Excel in many ways, after the
          workshop you will find that it can improve your work efficiency and
