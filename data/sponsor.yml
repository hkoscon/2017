            Glacéau vitaminwater has always been a simple idea. start with water. 
            and then add bold, fruity flavors and just the right amount of sugar 
            to make it delicious. finally, top it off with a little extra 
            nutrition. genius. and it never would’ve happened if someone hadn't 
            looked at a plain bottle of water and said, "what if this was a little better?"
            making things a little better is what makes Glacéau vitaminwater great.
